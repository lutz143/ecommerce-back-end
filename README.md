## Description
This project is an exercise in building the back end of a site that requires ecommerce interaction with a client. It utilizes Express.js API and configures the MySQL database through Sequelize. Additionally, it is a demonstration of the use of one to one and one to many SQL join associations for proper data handling to perform GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
